Outside of my day job, I am passionate about responsible AI. In this, I’ve conducted research and worked on projects. 

## Projects

I’ve contributed to several projects promoting responsible AI. One [project](https://avidml.org/blog/indie-label/) was the [IndieLabel Space on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/spaces/avid-ml/indie-label), “a collaboration between researchers at the [Stanford HCI Group](https://hci.stanford.edu/) and [ARVA (The AI Risk and Vulnerability Alliance)](https://avidml.org/arva/).” Another project was recognized as a [finalist in the Stanford Institute for Human-centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) AI Audit Challenge](https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-audit-challenge-2023-finalists).

## Research

In the area of responsible AI, I’ve published two pieces of research. 

[Comparing the Perceived Legitimacy of Content Moderation Processes: Contractors, Algorithms, Expert Panels, and Digital Juries](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3512929) investigates how the public perceives the legitimacy of algorithms - such as AI - in comparison to other common forms of content moderation. It was published in [CSCW 2022](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3512929). My fellow authors and I were invited to write a policy brief for [HAI](https://hai.stanford.edu/policy-brief-algorithms-and-perceived-legitimacy-content-moderation).

In addition, I wrote an [honors thesis](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/dy769ps6339) at Stanford investigating how society can compel developers to incorporate transparency into ML systems during the development process. It was [nominated for the Firestone medal](https://undergrad.stanford.edu/about-vpue/awards-and-graduation-honors/golden-firestone-and-kennedy-thesis-awards), which recognizes the top 10 percent of Stanford honors theses completed in a given year.
