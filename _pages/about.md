Hi! I am an AI/technical Product Manager with enterprise-level experience at AWS, Google, Intuit, and multiple startups. My expertise lies in AI/ML, cloud product development, e-commerce, accounting, warehouse management systems (WMS), and design thinking.

Outside of my day job, I am passionate about responsible AI. In this, I've conducted research and worked on projects. My work has been published in [CSCW](https://dl.acm.org/conference/cscw), featured on the [Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI)](https://hai.stanford.edu/), and recognized as a finalist in the HAI AI Audit Challenge.
